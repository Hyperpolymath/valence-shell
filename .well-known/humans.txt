/* VERIFICATION STATUS */

Formal Proofs: ~256 theorems across 6 systems
Proof Lines: ~4,280 lines
Implementation Status: Research Prototype (v0.5.0)
Production Ready: NO - Extraction gap exists

What's Proven:
✅ Directory creation/deletion reversibility
✅ File creation/deletion reversibility
✅ File content read/write reversibility
✅ Operation independence
✅ Operation composition
✅ Equivalence relations (algebraic structure)
✅ CNO = identity element

What's NOT Proven:
❌ OCaml FFI correctness
❌ Extraction from Coq to OCaml
❌ POSIX syscall correspondence
❌ End-to-end verification

/* FRAMEWORK */

MAA: Mutually Assured Accountability

- RMR: Remove-Match-Reverse (reversible operations, proven)

TPCF: Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework
- Perimeter 1: Core (formal proofs, maintainers only)
- Perimeter 2: Extensions (implementations, trusted contributors)
- Perimeter 3: Community (examples, tutorials, anyone)
