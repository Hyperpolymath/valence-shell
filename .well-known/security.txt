# About Valence Shell

Valence Shell is a formally verified shell implementing the MAA (Mutually
Assured Accountability) framework. We use polyglot verification across 6
proof systems (Coq, Lean 4, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, Mizar, Z3).

# Security Model

Current version (0.5.0) is a RESEARCH PROTOTYPE.

✅ Formally Proven:
- Directory operations reversibility (~256 theorems)
- File content operations reversibility
- Operation independence and composition

⚠️  NOT Verified:
- OCaml FFI implementation
- POSIX syscall interface
- Extraction correctness

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION. This is research software.

# Vulnerability Reporting

For security issues:

1. Open a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred):
   https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/valence-shell/security/advisories/new

2. Open a GitLab Issue (alternative):
   https://gitlab.com/non-initiate/rhodinised/vsh/-/issues
   Tag with "security" label

3. Email: [To be added]

Response time: 7 days (best-effort, research project)

# What to Report

Critical issues include:
- Arbitrary code execution
- Proof invalidation (breaks mathematical guarantee)
- Security property violations
- Unintended data loss

# Public Disclosure

This is a research project. We follow academic norms for responsible
disclosure. For non-critical issues, public issue tracker is preferred.

For critical issues that could affect users, we request 90-day
coordinated disclosure.

# Scope

In scope:
- Formal proofs (Coq, Lean 4, Agda, Isabelle, Mizar)
- OCaml implementation
- Elixir reference implementation
- Build and distribution infrastructure

Out of scope:
- Third-party dependencies (report upstream)
- Issues in proof assistants themselves (report to their teams)
- Issues in POSIX/Linux kernel (report to kernel team)

# Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Acknowledged in SECURITY.md Hall of Fame (with permission)
- Credited in release notes
- Invited to be listed in humans.txt
