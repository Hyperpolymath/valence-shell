Option 3: Palimpsest License v0.8 (RECOMMENDED as dual license)
================================================================================

PREAMBLE

The Palimpsest License is designed to protect the historical record of software
development while allowing maximum freedom for use and modification. It
requires that derivative works preserve the original authorship information
and modification history, creating a "palimpsest" of development.

This license is compatible with and can be used alongside MIT or GPL.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. DEFINITIONS

   "Original Work" means the software and associated documentation files
   as originally published by the copyright holder.

   "Derivative Work" means any work based upon or derived from the Original
   Work, including modifications, translations, or adaptations.

   "Palimpsest Record" means the preserved history of authorship, modifications,
   and attribution required by this license.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Subject to the terms of this license, you are granted:

   a) The right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
      and/or sell copies of the Original Work or Derivative Works

   b) The right to permit persons to whom the work is furnished to do the same

   c) The right to create Derivative Works

3. PALIMPSEST REQUIREMENTS

   All Derivative Works must include:

   a) A clear statement that the work is derived from the Original Work

   b) Preservation of all original copyright notices and attribution

   c) A record of significant modifications, including:
      - Date of modification
      - Author of modification
      - Description of changes

   d) This license file with both original and modification records intact

4. ATTRIBUTION

   You must give appropriate credit to the original authors, provide a link
   to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any
   reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses
   you or your use.

5. NO WARRANTY

   THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR

   Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the work.

7. COMPATIBILITY

   This license is explicitly compatible with:
   - MIT License
   - Apache License 2.0
   - BSD licenses (2-clause and 3-clause)
   - GPL v3 (when used as the more restrictive license)
   - Creative Commons Attribution licenses

   When dual-licensing with another license:
   - The Palimpsest requirements apply IN ADDITION to the other license
   - Users must comply with BOTH licenses
   - The more restrictive terms apply where licenses conflict

================================================================================
USAGE RIGHTS - YOU MAY CHOOSE:
================================================================================

Single License:
  ✓ MIT only              (maximum permissiveness)
  ✓ GPL v3 only           (strong copyleft)
  ✓ Palimpsest only       (attribution + history)

Dual License (RECOMMENDED):
  ★ MIT + Palimpsest      (permissive + attribution)
  ★ GPL + Palimpsest      (copyleft + attribution)

Triple License:
  ✓ MIT + GPL + Palimpsest (all protections)

WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE?

For maximum adoption:           MIT only
For ensuring freedom:           GPL v3 only
For attribution/reproducibility: MIT + Palimpsest (RECOMMENDED ★)
For copyleft + attribution:     GPL + Palimpsest
For academic research:          MIT + Palimpsest (best citation practices)

================================================================================
PHILOSOPHICAL ENCOURAGEMENT
================================================================================

While you are free to choose MIT only or GPL only, we ENCOURAGE dual licensing
with Palimpsest v0.8 because:

✓ It preserves attribution (credit where credit is due)
✓ It tracks modification history (reproducibility and transparency)
✓ It supports open science (understanding how software evolves)
✓ It's compatible with your other license choice (no restrictions)
✓ It helps future researchers understand the development process

Using Palimpsest WITH MIT or GPL gives you permissiveness/copyleft PLUS
the benefits of preserved history and attribution.

We believe software should carry its history, like a palimpsest manuscript
that reveals layers of development over time.

================================================================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Valence Shell Contributors

Licensed under MIT OR GPL-3.0-or-later, Palimpsest-0.8 recommended as dual.
