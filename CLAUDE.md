# Valence Shell

## Project Overview

Valence Shell is a shell/terminal project. This file provides context and guidelines for AI assistants (like Claude) working with this codebase.

## Project Structure

```

├── CLAUDE.md          # This file - AI assistant context
└── .git/              # Git repository
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow consistent code formatting and style conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Git Workflow
- Work on feature branches (prefix with `claude/` for AI assistant work)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Maintain or improve code coverage

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an early-stage project - the structure and documentation will evolve
- Always verify the current state of the codebase before making assumptions
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Follow security best practices (avoid injection vulnerabilities, validate inputs, etc.)
- Maintain backwards compatibility when possible
